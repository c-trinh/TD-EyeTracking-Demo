// Components in ECS should have no behavior bound to them. They are here just to store data. Their data is given to systems that manipulate it and then give the new data back.

// Any standard class can be used as a component but typically you'll want ti keep your components lightweight and specific.
// Components can be added and removed anytime by systems
